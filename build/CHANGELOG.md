- [Changed] The `c:\tools\scripts\Watch-Directory.ps1` no longer deletes destination directories, only files. See [#89](https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-images/issues/89). Thanks [@sshushliapin](https://github.com/sshushliapin) :+1:
- [Fixed] The `c:\tools` folder was empty.
- [**Breaking**] Windows and Linux "Sitecore PowerShell Extensions" images is now correctly tagged with `spe` instead of `pse`.
- [**Breaking**] Linux variant tags aligned with Windows variant tags, variant version is not part of tag anymore, latest compatible version is always used. Old images moved to `./legacy/linux`.
- [**Breaking**] When building, then default value used for the `-Tags` parameter will now *only* build images of the latest Sitecore version (including variants such as SXA/SPE) on the latest LTSC (Long Term Support Channel) Windows version instead of *everything*. As of today that would be Sitecore 9.2.0 on `windowsservercore-ltsc2019`. To build everything you could use `-Tag "*"`, see [README.md](/README.md#setting-up-automated-builds) for more details.
- [**Breaking**] Switched from using SIF to manual installing contents from the Sitecore WDP's.
  - Official `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet` images are now used at runtime:
    - Sitecore in now installed into `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` instead of `C:\inetpub\sc`.
    - IIS site `Default Web Site` and application pool `DefaultAppPool` is now used instead of `sc`.
  - The `WatchDirectory.ps1` helper script has been moved from `C:\Sitecore\Scripts`:
    - It's now in `C:\tools\scripts` and this path is also in the system PATH.
    - New script `Invoke-XdtTransform.ps1` added.
  - Docker files has been rewritten (also with comments) and images are now smaller and has fewer layers.
- [**Breaking**] Windows base and variant images merged into `.\windows`:
  - When calling `Invoke-PackageRestore` and `Invoke-Build` you need to point to `.\windows` going forward.
  - The previous `.\images`, `.\variants` and `.\tests` is moved into `.\legacy` so you can still build them if needed.
    - **IMPORTANT**: Do not build both `.\windows` **and** `.\legacy\images` (or `.\legacy\variants`) as they will **overwrite each other** as *many* tags are the same.
  - New docker-compose files added for testing into `.\windows\tests`, you can override the default values in the `.env` file using system environment variables to test other Sitecore versions and/or Windows versions.
- [**Breaking**] Sitecore XM images has been renamed from `sitecore-xm1-*` to `sitecore-xm-*`.
- [**Breaking**] Sitecore license file `license.xml` is no longer embedded into the images and you are now **required** to mount a folder that has the license into `C:\license` inside the containers.
- [Added] Quick start `.\Build.ps1` script added for simpler on-boarding when you just want to try out Sitecore on Docker. See [README.md](/README.md#quick-start) for more details.
- [Changed] XM and XP Solr images on Windows now has the Sitecore schema embedded like the Linux images. No need to remember to run "Populate managed schema" anymore.
- [Changed] Made the `-Registry` parameter optional. Not specifying the `-Registry` will build the images locally only.

## September 2019

- [Fixed] Invalid download url in `sitecore-packages.json` was fixed for JSS 11.0.1 XP CM. **IMPORTANT**: Remove the file `Sitecore JavaScript Services Server for Sitecore 9.1.1 XP 11.0.1 rev. 190318.scwdp.zip` from where you store the packages and **ALSO** also inside `.\variants\9.1.1\windowsservercore\jss\sitecore-xp-jss-11.0.1-standalone\` so the package will be re-downloaded.

- [Fixed] Multi-stage builds on Docker engine 19.03.1, see [https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4349](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/4349). Temporary workaround applied to affected Docker files.
